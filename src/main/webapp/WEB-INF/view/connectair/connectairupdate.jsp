Dear Team <br><br>

For all of us, today is the first day in a new chapter with Flybe and Stobart Air, as part of Connect Airways. I am thrilled and very excited to be part of this. We have a unique opportunity to create something very special, as one team, and it is a real honour and a privilege to lead this new independent business.I am also really looking forward to getting to know you much better.
Attached you will see our media release for your information and here is the link to a short video message that 
I filmed: <a > https://link.stobartair.com/.</a>&nbsp;
Hopefully this gives you a bit more about me and my initial thoughts and immediate plans for our future.

I am also excited to share the news that Graeme Buchanan will become part of my leadership team as Chief Financial Officer of Connect Airways. I am looking forward to working with Graeme who I know will bring great insight to the team. As a result of Graeme transferring to the CFO role, Andy Jolly will become the acting Managing Director of Stobart Air. 
<br><br>We will work to define the leadership team over the coming weeks and share more details with you when we know. There are no other changes to the current leadership teams.

With the heritage and regional expertise of Flybe and the operational strength of Stobart Air, we can focus on growing in the UK, Ireland and Europe  concentrating on playing to our strengths in connecting regional communities, while growing our franchise business. We also have an opportunity to redefine what our customers can expect, rebranding under the powerful Virgin name.
Our first priority has to be to continue to build a secure business for all of us and our customers, with safety at the core of everything we do. Making sure that we focus on doing things safely, in a consistent and sustainable way, with effective planning, process and operational excellence, will be key to us building a successful future.
A top priority for me is to build our team spirit. It is time now for us to rediscover the excitement and passion of being Europes largest regional airline and a growing franchise business. Together, we will build a new purpose and set of common values that we all truly believe in and get behind. My job, and that of the leadership team, is to help you be the best version of yourself and to flourish as we grow. 
It is not about working harder -  I know you work incredibly hard already. <br><br> I do believe it is about all of us being smart. This is a turnaround and we are going to have to have a laser-like focus on where we put our effort and resource, to make the biggest difference quickly. 
I am sure you have a lot of questions, including details of the new brand name, the logo and uniforms.   Over the next few weeks we will work together to define the final look and unveil this to our customers, when we are ready.
We will only pull this off by working as one team, always in everything we do. No matter how good each of us is, I have learnt that an airline is perhaps the most interconnected organisation you can be part of. Creating something amazing, that will last, will depend on each of us playing our part but realising that it is only by being the best team that we win. As your leader, you have my promise and commitment that I will never lose sight of this and work hard to achieve it.
We will continue to share news and information regularly, but if you have any immediate questions please email &nbsp; <a> internalcomms@connectairways.com </a>&nbsp;
In the meantime, I am looking forward to meeting everyone, starting with Flybe teams in Exeter today and Stobart Air in Dublin tomorrow, as well as teams at our bases in the weeks ahead. A schedule of these visits will be shared in advance and I hope to see as many of you there as possible; your ideas, thoughts and feedback are really important for me.  
Here is to our future together.

<br>
